# Lightsey_ScientificReports_2025
This repository contains a reproducible RNA-seq analysis and figure generation workflow in **R** used to produce publication-quality figures for comparative transcriptomic studies.   The pipeline implements standard normalization, PCA, correlation analysis, heatmaps, GSVA pathway scoring, and differential expression with `edgeR` and `limma`.
